#Assembling Base/Bed Platform

To make it easier to assemble we modified the design of Prusa i3, and changed M8 threaded rods for all threaded rods and M8 nuts for all Nuts (same size), you only need to make sure that you used correct length rods.

##Heatbed Mounting
Now you should have the printer assembled almost 50%, now lets put the Heatbed.

Follow the instruction in the video to prepare the heabed and mounting https://www.youtube.com/embed/xVRny7qUN24

**Note:** If you don't get silicon glue, then use simple kapton tape, that should suffice, we have included the small length of Kapton tape in the KIT.
