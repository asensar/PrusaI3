#Assembling Prusa i3 Frame

To make it easier and simpler to assemble Prusai3 kits sold by DIY-India.com are redesigned the frame to use only M3 Nuts and M3x20 Allen Hex bolt, so you need not to worry about which bolt to use. 

So for assembling the frame where ever we say nut/nuts use M3 nut, where every we mention bolt/bolts use M3x20 bolt

##Main frame and side frame assembling

As a first step, we should attach the main frame with side frame.
